## Project overview

This repository contains the code implementation and data for a novel joint estimation algorithm to improve the kinematic accuracy of surgical robots. The proposed solution is divided into 3 main steps: (1) calibration, (2) calculation of corrected joints and (3) neural network correction. These steps can be followed by using the sampled data and scripts below.

## Installation instructions

All the main functions from this project were organized into a python module which you can install with 

```
pip install -e .
```

After installing the module, open a python terminal and write 

```
import kincalib
```

to ensure the module was correctly installed.
